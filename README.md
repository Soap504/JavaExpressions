# Expression Evaluation System 

## Project Description

This Java project is dedicated to the development of a comprehensive expression evaluation system, with a primary focus on the conversion of arithmetic expressions from infix to postfix notation and subsequent evaluation of the results. The project aims to provide a robust solution for handling various types of expressions efficiently and accurately. 

The core functionality of the system is encapsulated within the `Expression` class, which serves as the backbone for managing operators during the conversion process. Leveraging a custom Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT), the system ensures seamless handling of expressions, even in complex scenarios. 

Rigorous testing methodologies have been employed to validate the correctness and reliability of the system. Various test cases covering a wide range of expression scenarios have been meticulously designed and executed to ensure that the system performs as expected under different conditions. 

Furthermore, the project report offers a comprehensive analysis of the Abstract Data Type (ADT) used in the implementation, detailing its design, functionality, and relevance to the project. Additionally, the report delves into the testing methodologies employed, providing insights into the strategies used to validate the system's correctness and robustness. 

Evaluation criteria for the project encompass not only the correctness of the implemented solution but also the quality and clarity of the project report. Adherence to coding standards and best practices is also a key aspect of the evaluation process.

## Project Components

### Expression.java

The `Expression` class serves as the central component of the system, responsible for managing the conversion of infix expressions to postfix notation and evaluating the results. It implements various algorithms and data structures to achieve efficient expression handling.
