# Expression Evaluation System

## Project Overview
This Java project implements an expression evaluation system, focusing on converting arithmetic expressions from infix to postfix notation and evaluating the results. The project is developed as part of the CS-2400-02-f23 course.

## Features
- Expression Conversion: Converts arithmetic expressions from infix to postfix notation.
- Evaluation: Evaluates the postfix expression to produce a result.
- Custom Stack ADT: Utilizes a custom Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) to manage operators during the conversion process.
- Rigorous Testing: Includes comprehensive testing covering diverse scenarios to ensure accurate handling of expressions.

## Project Structure
- Main Class: `Expression` class, which handles the core functionalities of the expression conversion and evaluation.
- Custom Stack: Custom implementation of a Stack ADT to support the `Expression` class.

## Testing
The project includes rigorous testing to cover a variety of scenarios, ensuring the correct handling of different types of expressions. The testing methodology is detailed in the project report.

## Report
The project report contains:
- ADT Description: Detailed explanation of the custom Stack ADT used in the project.
